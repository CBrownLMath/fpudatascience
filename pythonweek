Put your name and a brief reflection on what you think of Github! 
Brandon: Github can be confusing but I love how it keeps track of changes! 
This is during the live class! 















CBrownLMath: did my earlier comment get removed when someone else overwrote it? Because I do no see it when I return to re-edit. Or am I now editing the original
    posting? So, Brandon is answering my question in real time and I am typing my understanding of it. This will show up in some other branch. No because it will 
    show up in CBrownLMath-patch-1.
